# About Vue Vixens Workshops

Vue Vixens is an initiative created by Jen Looper, a Senior Developer Advocate at [Progress](http://www.progress.com), creators of NativeScript, Kendo UI, Open Edge, and more. Vue Vixens' mission is to create workshops to teach Vue.js in a cool and fun way to 'foxy people who identify as women'. It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular community, [http://www.ng-girls.org](ng-girls.org). Ng-Girls was in turn inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives.

::: tip Not just workshops!
We do more than full day workshops! We also can help with your conference's diversity offerings - just contact us at [info@vuevixens.org](mailto:info@vuevixens.org).

These workshops are designed to help people get better acquainted with both Vue.js and NativeScript-Vue, an implementation of Vue.js that lets developers write native mobile apps using Vue. 3/4 of a standard workshop day is spent on the web, and 1/4 on mobile. Below is an interview with Jen and Evan You, creator of Vue, and Igor Randjelovic, creator of NativeScript-Vue, giving the background and history of the projects.

## FAQ

**What's the difference between a Chapter and a 'Mini'?**

These chapters are presented as two distinct types. The first five chapters comprise the full-day workshop. Other chapters are listed as 'mini-workshops' and can be done ad hoc with groups for breakfasts, lunch'n'learn sessions, or meetups. We are adding to this content progressively.

**Why are the chapters broken up into parts?**

All the online codelabs are designed to be completed in groups in a self-study mode in a workshop format during meetups, conferences, and brown-bag lunches. For the all-day workshops, it is best to break up the day into parts and regroup users periodically so that 'no developer is left behind'. If an attendee gets lost, she can 'reboot' by downloading the ending point for each previous chapter into a new Code Sandbox.

**Where can I register for a skulk?**

Workshop attendees and mentors can register for events at [http://www.vuevixens.org](vuevixens.org). Keep an eye on our Twitter feed @vuevixens for announcements of upcoming events. Vue Vixens workshops are free, but depend on budget from conferences and meetups to provide lunch, breakfast, or snacks, and a space with wifi.

**I'm a guy. Can I participate?**

The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such with concepts of programming for web and mobile using Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. Experienced Vue developers, however, are very welcome to join in our efforts to organize events, support our scholarship fund, mentor a skulk, and provide content. We are grateful for all kinds of help!
